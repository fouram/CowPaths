1. Overview
   Cow Paths is a bukkit plugin for simulating the natural erosion
   caused by player walking. The name of the plugin comes from the
   phrase "to pave the cow paths." As players walk around the
   server, Cow Paths keeps track of the number of times each block
   has been stepped on and erodes the world accordingly. By default,
   the world erosion patterns are (with step thresholds in
   parentheses):
   
     Grass -(10)-> Dirt -(50)-> Gravel -(200)-> Cobblestone 
           -(800)-> Smooth Stone
      
     Sand  -(100)-> Sandstone
     
2. Configuration
   The erosion patters and step thresholds used by Cow Paths are
   completely configurable. All wear patterns are stored in the
   config.yml file under the wearPatterns key. A wear pattern
   is made up of a three part string containing the fromMaterial,
   toMaterial, and stepThreshold. A line looks like this:
   
     - Grass Dirt 10
     
   When defining the fromMaterial and toMaterial, you can use
   either a material's canonical name or ID number. Malformed wear
   patterns will be ignored. If two wear patterns share the same
   fromMaterial, only the first one will be used.
